<h1>Personal Private Overview</h1>
    
<h2>Short Biography</h2>

<h3>Introductory Words</h3>

<p>This webspace is a simple introduction to who I am and what I do. My main
interest lies on photography and graphic design. I have just over 40 years of
experience in both fields. Everything about images and image manipulation is
of highly interest for me. Currently I am also interested in Artificial
Intelligence, Generative Artificial Intelligence image generation and last but
not least I am interested in Crypto Coin as well as NFT technology.</p>  
    
<p>Since the 80s I have been programming using different programming languages
on different computer systems. But over a decade I am no longer working on 
personal computers with the operating system Windows. At that time when I used
DOS together with Windows I had in parallel to work on Unix as well as on Sinix
and worked private on Linux. My first Linux distribution I used was SUSE Linux.
I am now working for a long time exclusively under Linux, use only open source
software and do my own programming.</p> 

<p>Every now and then I deal with robot technology. The focus is on building
and programming robots myself. I design also simple sensors for the robots,
but I also use modules that are available on the market like ultrasonic
modules.</p> 
    
<p>In mathematics, physics as well as computer science and technology I am also 
interested. One topic I deal with at regular intervals is the number Pi and how 
to calculate it. I am further on interested in theology, philosophy and history.
</p>

<p>My artistic interest is also reflected in the fact that I like to paint model
building models myself. These can be figures, vehicles, buildings or special
landscapes for tabletop. Modelling and colour design of model landscapes is also
included here.</p>

<p>I read a lot, especially literature of technical interest, as well as literature
on history worldwide, science fiction and fantasy in book and booklet form. I like 
board games, at least the old ones, which are less politically correct, and I 
played in young years semi-professional chess and play from time to time chess
for fun.</p>

<p>At the moment, GitHub in particular is a vendor's tray for me with various 
repositories on different topics. Through this website, I am trying to bring some
order to the things that are important to me and that might also be of interest 
to others.</p>  

<p>I will not go into too much detail on this page. Some statements may therefore
be somewhat imprecise. This page is intended to provide no more and no less than
an overview of what I am involved with.</p> 
    
<h3>Corporate Identity</h3>
    
<p>Whenever you see my banner, my logo or my avatar, than the creator and owner 
should be me of the related web space. As my graphics are often stolen - they must 
be really good enough for some people - one needs to take a closer look to see if
it is me or a dummy or fake site. This can be easily checked by cross links, if my
pseudonym or alias, my banner, my logo as well as my avatar is the same and so on.
</p>

<p>I essentially use two logos, which are also available to me as NFTs:</p>

<ul class="earth_americas">
    <li><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8f38d8148b5fee7b42e4e2cdefc55de900a3f7af/4/">Logo Bob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x8f38d8148b5fee7b42e4e2cdefc55de900a3f7af/5/">Logo Cube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both logos were originally SVG graphics files created with the vector graphics
programme Inkscape. For use as NFTs, both SVG files were converted to the JPG/JPEG
file format. If I need a tranparent background, I am using both files in the PNG
file format.</p>

<h3>Information Technology Related Online Activities</h3>    
    
<h4>üêæ Presence in Social Media Channels</h4>
    
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://x.com/zentrocdot">X</a> (formally Twitter)
and recently also on
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zentrocdot.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>.
Both are the showroom for my activities in graphic design and programming. You can 
also find me on the communication platform
<a href="https://discord.gg/T4NsWzrk">Discord</a>. I have also a web presence at
<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zentrocdot">Buymeacoffee</a>. The latter one is
not maintained by me so often these days.</p>

<h4>üêæ Presence on Developer Platforms</h4>
    
<p>I am active from time to time here at 
<a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot">GitHub</a>. 
And last but not least I am every now and again at Launchpad and CPAN. Due to a 
lack of time, I am currently spending less time on 
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~zentrocdot"> Launchpad</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/ZTENRETEP">CPAN</a>. Unfortunately, I do
not have the time I need for GitHub, Launchpad and CPAN.</p>

<p>The entry page for users and developers is on GitHub [2] and Launchpad [3] the 
same. For CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, the entry site for users is
[4] and for developers [5]. As developer work is waiting for me on all of the three
named platforms.</p>

<h4>üêæ Generative AI Related Community</h4>
    
<p>After some initial hesitation, I took a closer look at CIVITAI and am now very
impressed with this platform. Accordingly one can find me also now on 
<a href="https://civitai.com/user/zentrocdot">CIVITAI</a>.
On CIVITA one can find Embeddings or Textual Inversions, Hypernetworks, LoRAs,
DreamBooth models as well as merged base models of myself. Last but not least
there are also images of different kind I created.</p>   

<p>The donations in honour of my activities I regularly receive at CIVITAI are
great. It really motivates me to do more and to do it faster.</p>
    
<h4>üêæ Presence on NFT Marketplaces</h4>
   
<p>As I wrote I am interested in the NFT technology. In this area I am active at
three places. One can find me on
<a href="https://opensea.io/zentrocdot">Opensea</a>, 
<a href="https://rarible.com/zentrocdot">Rarible</a> and 
<a href="https://magiceden.io/u/zentrocdot?chains=%5B%22polygon%22%5D&wallets=%5B%220x8cBDE1015019f21bac2c68866A65f23eD2daC6A4%22%5D&activeTab=%22allItems%22">Magic Eden</a>. 
Most of the NFTs there are for personal use. Some are to give them away in good hands.
I have also tried a few others. However, they were unsatisfactory in all respects.  
</p>

<h2>Photography and Grafic Design</h2>

<h3>Photography</h3>    

<p>I have been involved with photography, image creation and image manipulation all
my life. Be it at school, at university or simply in my private life. At school, I 
attended the photo study group in addition to the computer science study group.</p>

<p>Long before it gave digital cameras I used mechanical cameras. I developed 35mm
films myself and also developed images myself in the darkroom. As I don't throw 
anything away, I still have the apparatus somewhere in which you could load the
films and then develop them.</p>

<h3>Graphical Software</h3>

<p>Linux is a good platform when it comes to tools for photography and graphic 
design. Linux has one weakness compared to Windows. Printed Good print quality 
is easier to realise with Windows if the appropriate drivers are available.</p>   

<p>Subsequently listed Tools are in use by me:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚úíÔ∏è'">
    <li>RawTherapee</li>
    <li>Gimp</li>
    <li>G'MIC</li>
    <li>Inkscape</li>
    <li>ImageMagick</li>
</ul>

<p>RawTherapee is a programme aimed at photographers. Gimp is a good image editing
programme. G'MIC is among other things a plugin for Gimp. Inkscape is a good vector
graphics programme. Last but not least ImageMagick is a command line tool for image 
manipulation of all kinds.</p>

<p>As I learned Stable Diffusion can be used for much more than simple AI image
generation. With Stable Diffusion images can be easily upscaled. A magic eraser
functionality can be realised by Stable Diffusion too.</p>  

<p>The possibilities of the Generative Artificial Image Generation are an 
interesting extension if you work with photos and graphics.</p>     

<h3>Vector Graphics</h3>

<p>In addition to photography and image processing, I also work with vector graphics
and take from time to time a deeper look in the possibilities of vector graphics.
Vector graphics or the SVG graphic format is nothing else than XML. In this way vector
graphics can simply be programmed.</p>

<svg width="99%" height="50px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<rect width="99%" height="40px" x="5" y="5" rx="10" ry="10" style="fill:rgb(255,255,255);stroke-width:1;stroke:gray"/>  
<text x="25" y="30" fill="black">This is not HTML, as one might think, but an example for SVG!</text>
</svg>   

<p>What you can do in Inkscape you can do in the context of a website also. Much 
more dangerous is the second feature of a SVG graphic. One can realise motion
using JavaScript. One nice example of a clock can be found at [8].</p>

<p>Here are some example of vector graphic art I created a long time ago:</p>
    
<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/math-art-work-collection">Vector Graphic Art</a><br>

<p>This is another good example that NFTs are much more than tradable items. My 
favourite examples are in the IPFS.</p>

<h3>Base64 Graphics</h3>

<p>There are a second way to integrate images in HMTL. For this one can use Base64 images.</p> 

<div><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:2px;" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAwAAAAMCAYAAABWdVznAAASNXpUWHRSYXcgcHJvZmlsZSB0eXBlIGV4aWYAAHjapZptcuM8koT/4xR7BOIbOA4+I/YGe/x9EqRkqdsTE++MHbbVFEQAVVmZWWCb9X//u83/8BVqTibEXFJN6eIr1FBd40W57q92ftsrnN

<h2>Generative Artificial Image Generation</h2>

<h3>Introduction in Artificial Image Generation</h3>  

<h4>üì∑ Generative AI Image Generation</h4>

<p>Images of various types can be created with AI as standard. Such created images are
 of type Prompt Art. This is the hint, that AI image generation is Text-To-Image generation.</p> 

<p>The next picture of a white devil cat with a hat is AI-generated. The horns do
not match the cat, nor do the ears, and the physique is not that of a cat either. Nevertheless, the cat looks photorealistic. The main problem with such an image is
the eyes. A closer look at the picture shows this. A post-processing step using
inpainting can be used to improve eyes that have gone wrong.</p>  

<p>
<img class="img_img" src="./images/devil_cat.jpg" alt="devil cat">     
</p> 
    
<p>An important topic is the lighting within a particular Prompt. To show how the
lighting can be influenced, I have written an article about the corresponding keywords.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è'"> 
    <li><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zentrocdot/control-lighting-stable-diffusion">
    Control Lighting in Stable Diffusion</a></li>  
</ul>

<p>I prepared a NFT collection in which each image has a changed or different lighting condition.</p>

</ul>

<h4>üé• mp4 Video Created Using AI</h4>

<p>What is less well known is that the same web user interfaces can also create videos.
The following mp4 video shows this very clearly.</p>   

<video class="img_img" controls>
    <source src="./images/cat.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<h3>Stable Diffusion Model Development</h3>

<h4>Models in Use</h4>

<p>Following types of models I am developing so far:</p>   
 
<ul style="list-style-type: '‚úèÔ∏è'">
    <li>Embeddings / Textual Inversions</li>
    <li>Hypernetworks</li>
    <li>LoRA models</li>
    <li>DreamBooth models</li>
    <li>Base models</li>
</ul>

<p>Following types of models I am developing so far:</p>  

<p>At the moment my focus lies on Embeddings, Hypernetworks and LoRAs.</p>    

<h4>Models Explained</h4> 

<p>By default and historically, there are two types of models that can be easily
created. Embeddings or Textual Inversions as well as Hypernetworks can be trained 
using the Extension Train by default from within AUTOMATIC1111. If one trains an
Embedding, the result looks like the trained images. Hypernetworks quite different
to this behaviour. A Hypernetwork modifies the behaviour of the items in an image
they are trained on.</p>

<h3>Programming Extensions for the Web UI AUTOMATIC1111</h3> 

<p>I have always lacked options for working more effectively in AI image generation.
Since AUTOMATIC1111 offers the option of integrating self-programmed Extensions in
the web UI, I familiarised myself with the programming of these Extensions.</p>

<p>The Extensions I have developed so far can be found here:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è'"> 
  <li><a href="./html/extensions.html">Extensions for the AUTOMATIC1111 web UI </a></li>  
</ul>

<p>The corresponding website is updated according to the development status of the
individual Extensions. Each Extension has more or less good documentation to date.</p>    
 
<h2>NFT Technology</h2>
    
<h3>Thoughts About NFT Technology</h3>  

<p>Today, NFT marketplaces are far more than just platforms on which NFTs can be
traded. If you utilise the possibilities correctly, these marketplaces are galleries
for your own ideas and images.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that the common NFT marketplaces make it easy
to mint NFTs. It is much more complicated to set up a working environment that allows
to mint NFTs. In my case, this is not an option for now as it is too time consuming.
</p>

<p>It looks to me as if NFTs are still only seen as an object for speculation. I do 
not think this does the technology justice. With NFTs, you can have your own pictures
with you anytime and anywhere. Access is easy via smartphone, tablet or personal computer
to each time and at each location.</p>    

<h3>Favourite NFT Image Collections</h3>  

<p>Art should be shown. In order to realise this for myself personally, I have been
creating NFTs for a long time. That way I can carry the pictures around in my wallet.</p>

<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

<h3>Programming Languages I am Familiar With</h3>

<p>Some of the programming languages I am more or less familiar with are:</p>
  
<ul style="list-style-type: 'üîπ'">
    <li>Machine Language</li>
    <li>Assembler</li>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Basic</li>
    <li>Pascal/Turbo Pascal</li>
    <li>Fortran</li>
    <li>Batch</li>  
    <li>Visual Basic</li>
    <li>Shell/Bash</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Perl</li> 
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Markdown</li>  
    <li>HTML/XML</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>sed</li>
    <li>awk</li>  
    <li>bc</li>
    <li>roff</li>
    <li>Tex/LaTex</li>
    <li>Tcl/Tk</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list is certainly not complete. I always use the programming language
that gets me to my goal the quickest. See also [2] for an incredible long list of
outdated and current programming languages. If necessary, I also learn a new
programming language.</p>

<p>My favourite programming languages are Bash, Python and Perl. First I take a 
look, if a problem can be solved using Bash, than I take a look, if a ploblem can 
be solved using Python. Last but not least I am deciding if I have to use Perl or
another Programming language.</p>

<h3>Comments on the Mentioned Programming Languages</h3>    

<h4>üìó Machine Language</h4>  

<p>In computer programming, machine code is the computer code consisting of 
machine language instructions, which are used to control and interact with the 
central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. For conventional computers on binary
base, machine code is the binary representation of a computer program which can be 
read and interpreted by the computer respectively by the CPU. Such a program in 
machine code consists of a sequence of machine instructions sometime interspersed
with data. Machine code commands can be processed directly by a CPU as mentioned. 
Each command is given in binary form with zeros and ones.</p>

<p>The machine code is by definition not natural for human beings. Here comes the
assembler into play. An assembler works with the so-called mnemonics which makes
progamming on processor level easier and more natural for a human being. Commands
are no longer given in a combination of zeros and ones. Assembler uses e.g commands
like shift arithmetic right (SAR) and shift logical right (SHR). The list of available
assembler commands varies from processor type to procesor type. One good example is a
so-called RISC processor, whereas RISC is the abbreviation for Reduced Instruction Set
Computer.<p>

<h4>üìò C/C++</h4> 

<p>The next level on programming languages are C/C++ which are near to the assembler 
programming. Other programming languages
e.g. are again written in C/C++.</p>

<h4>üìò Shell/Bash</h4> 

<p>What Batch programming was under Windows, Shell/Bash programming is under Linux. 
At least they are comparable in terms of
their approach, before I am criticised for the above statement.</p>

<h4>üìò sed, awk and bc</h4> 
    
<p>sed, awk as well as bc are commonly known as Bash commands. What most people 
do not realise or know is that sed, awk and bc are fully-fledged programming
languages. bc is somehow a special case, but it is also a programming language
when we talk about mathematical operations. Both sed and awk are proven 
Turing-complete programming languages.</p>

</ul>

<h4>üìò Python</h4>

<p>For a long time Python is next to Bash my favourite programming language. When I
started programming I was not really happy that one needs to import most of the time
modules for use in the script or programme. Taking into account that Python can be
extended by modules in PIP this concept is much more useful. One has core Python, standard Python modules and third party Python modules in PIP.

</p>
    
<h3>Programming Language Versus Interpreter and Compiler</h3>
    
<h4>üìò What Is a Programming Language</h4>  

<p>In the large digital landscape, programming languages are the lingua franca in
software development and enable global conversations between machines, developers 
and programmers, wherever they may be located. A programming language is a set
of words and symbols that enables humans to communicate with a computer using 
instructions in a way a computer can understand. The programming language itself 
is nothing else than a collection of semantic rules and syntactic rules as well
as defined restrictions. Like a spoken language, a computer language has its 
own grammar, syntax, structure and vocabulary as well as shortcuts sometimes. 
To bring them to live one needs a interpreter or compiler or maybe a mixture 
from both.</p>

<h4>üìò What Is an Interpreter and What Is a Compiler</h4>

<p>While running a script or programme the interpreter is interpreting the code 
and reads the code line by line. A compiler creates binary code while compiling
from the source code. The result is an executable programme as bytecode. There 
are some cases in which interpreting and compiling are somehow combined. JAVA 
belongs to the latter version. Python is an interpretive programming language
whose scripts have the extension .py. Python can also uses bytecode with the
extension .pyc to speed things up if nothing changes in the programme code 
before. C/C++ are typical example for compiled programming languages. On the 
other hand side Python, Perl and Ruby are examples for typical interpreted 
programming languages.</p>

<h2>Self Programmed Applications</h2>

<h3>Hard- and Software Programming</h3>

<p>I programmed some high sophisticated application which I can not present in detail.</p>
    
<p>A long time ago, in the 80s, I programmed a self-designed and self-manufactured 
fully automatic calf feeding system in Turbo Pascal. The hardware and software was
intended to show that it was possible to do this with an x68 personal computer for
calf health to that time.</p> 

<p>I have programmed video surveillance monitors in Python. These allow you to take 
a look at one or more specific cameras when needed while video surveillance with 
motion detection was running in the background. This way I was able to help catch 
some bad girls and boys.</p>    
    
<h3>Wireless Access Point Scanner</h3>

<p>Since 2017, I have been using my own wireless access point scanner without making
any necessary changes. The tool is simple and easy to use. Programmed is the tool
using Bash.</p>    

<p>Installation can be done by using a PPA applying following steps:</p>    
    
<pre>
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zentrocdot/wapscan-cli
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install wapscan
</pre>  
    
<p>Informations and resources can be found here:</p> 

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è'">    
    <li><a href=" https://github.com/zentrocdot/wapscan_sd">https://github.com/zentrocdot/wapscan_sd</a></li>
</ul>

<p>wapscan is a tool for the terminal window. The tool can used with more than 
one wlan interfaces. It is as simple as possible. The goal is simply to show the
wireless access point in the surrounding with some impportant informations about
them.<p>

<p>When I have more time I have to take alook at the tool and have to check if an
update or upgrade is necessary.<p>

<h3>Prime Numbers</h3>

<p>You always need prime numbers. So I wrote a simple and quick programme that calculates prime numbers for me.</p>    

<p>Installation can be done by using a PPA applying following steps:</p>    
    
<pre>
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zentrocdot/prime-numbers
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install prime-numbers
</pre>  
    
<p>Informations and resources can be found here:</p> 

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è'">    
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot/prime-numbers">https://github.com/zentrocdot/prime-numbers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It simply calculates an number of requested primenumbers wihout formating them.<p>

<p>When I have much more time I have to take another look at the tool and have to check
if an update or upgrade might be necessary.<p>

<h2>Circle Constant Pi and Tau</h2>

<h3>üìù Brief History of Pi</h3>

<p>The first occurrence of Pi in mathematics is presumed and dated back around the 
year 3000BC and is related to the Indus valleyand to the civilisation of the same 
name in the indian subcontinent. Pi is the name of the well-known concept for a
circle constant. New approaches are thinking about the more natural usage of the 
circle constant as Tau.<p>
    
<h3>üìù Archimedes and Pi</h3>

<p>I am particularly proud of the fact that I was able to work through Archimedes'
foundations for calculating the circle number Pi in the form of SageMath notebooks,
which can be found here on GitHub. Archimedes' approach is based on ratios of
quantities and it is complicated to translate these ratios of quantities into
mathematical equations. One particular problem is that he used different approaches
for the inscribed circle and the circumscribed circle.<p>

<p>My resources can be found here:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: 'üìö'">
   <li><a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot/archimedes">https://github.com/zentrocdot/archimedes</a></li>
</ul>    

<p>When it comes to the calculation of Pi in connection with Archimedes, incorrect 
statements are usually made. At the time of Archimedes, techniques relating to
algebra and geometry that are used today to derive his calculation rule were not yet known.
These modern approaches are nothing more than a correct interpretation of his approaches,
nothing more and nothing less. The prove of the statement is given with 
a look in Archimedes' Circuli Dimensio and his 3 propositions.</p>

<p>This project has stalled because I don't have enough time.</p>

<h3>üìù Calculation of the Circle Constant Pi</h3>

<p>As far as the basis for calculating the circle number Pi is concerned, I went back
a long way into the past and conducted an intensive search for sources. This revealed
interesting aspects and approaches, some of which are reproduced incorrectly or
distorted in today's literature. For example, I also found calculation approaches
dating back round about 100 years that were already known in the Middle Ages. Next to
the geometric analysis I wrote a bunch of programmes in Python and Perl to this topic.
</p>

<p>I always work in an application-orientated way. That means I try things out first
and then I go into theory if necessary. I found out while working with different
approaches, that an approach of D√∂rrie and an approach of Snellius is able to speed 
up the calculation of Pi when we are talking about Archimedes' approach. It has to
be noted that the approach of D√∂rrie from the beginning of the last century goes back 
to the insights of scientists of the Middle Age.</p>

<p>This project has also stalled because I don't have enough time.</p>

<h2>Computers Through the Ages</h2>

<h3>Back to the 80s</h3>

<p>In the 80s I worked with the homecomputer C64, the Apple IIe and the IBM PC/AT
80286 computers. I was familiar with the other systems, but I wasn't interested in
them. The special features that characterised the C64 still fascinate me to this
day.</p>

<p>Onboard on the C64 board there was a video as well as a sound chip for video and
sound output. This way the C64 was complete to work with. Three special features should
be pointed out. That are PEEK and POKE on the one hand side. And that is the fact that
the C64 uses Sprites. With the command PEEK the memory could be read. With POKE the
memory could be written.</p>

<h3>Back to Today</h3>

<p>Nowadays, I am using motherboards for AMD microprocessors with AMD microprocessors when it comes to computers. My computer is more of a test rig than what people think of as a personal computer. I can use this type of computer for crypto mining, AI image generation or mathematical calculations.</p>

<p>A long time ago I had to decide which kind of single board computer I wanted to use
for some experiments and more. I decided to use a Raspberry Pi I have no regrets up
today. I used the RPi for roboter technique, for video surveillance, for media center
and as router. It is also used as mini computer with different Linux operating systems.</p>

<h3>Hard- and Software</h3>

<p>As a general rule, I assemble the computer hardware as I need it. I rarely deviate
from this rule. Is the hardware prepared, I install the OS I need as well as the
software I need. If I need special tool I am programming them.</p>

<h2>Hardware Development</h2>

<p>Sometimes I am developing hardware of each kind. This can be electronical,
electrical or also pure mechanical. Mechanical development can be supported
by CAD.</p>

<p>For mechanical hardward the CAD programme LibreCAD can be used. I developed a 
simple mechanical pressure measuring device for the household for use with standard
garden adapters.</p> 

<h2>Mathematical Software</h2>

<p>I am experienced in using the mathematical software Mathematica. In addition to 
this I also know a little bit about MATLAB and MuPad. I feel familiar with SageMath.
Last but not least I working with Scilab and Gnuplot.</p>

<h2>Further Resources of Interest</h2>

<p>I am working sometimes with the mathematics software system SageMath. To make a 
straight forward installation for me easier, if necessary on some reasons, I wrote
a installation guide.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è'">
   <li><a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot/SageMath">https://github.com/zentrocdot/SageMath</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To have the newest version of LibreOffice I figured out how to compile and install
it from source with language support and everything else what is neede to have a state
of the art system.</p>

<h2>About This Webspace</h2>

<h3>Webspace Creation</h3>

<p>This webspace was created by me in the familiar old-fashioned form. I wrote the
website with the help of a text editor. Sometimes I am using also HTML editors to
test certain things. As a rule, however, I am always much quicker at programming by
hand than when I use other tools like HTML editors.

<p>Since this webspace does not claim to be a professional webspace, this is
sufficient for me and for the presentation of information. Since I like the story
of Jekyll and Hyde, I will try the programming based on Jekyll when I have a lot
of idle time.</p>

<p>To get back into the HTML programming this webspace was really good training. I
am now almost back up to speed with the technical side of HTML programming belongs
to. Until now I have always avoided using CSS especially in a separate style file.
When programming this webspace, CSS proved to be a challenge, an enrichment and
advantage.</p>   

<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>

<p>This is also the second time that I am creating a website in responsive web design.
However, the first time was rather rudimentary in comparison to this webspace. The
reason to use responsive web design is quite simple. I am using like other more than
a desktop computer. To let the website look best on different devices the responsive
web design is needed.</p>

<h3>Tested Browser</h3>

<p>I checked the website on following browsers:</p>

<ul class="globe">
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Chrome</li>
  <li>Chromium</li>
  <li >Edge</li>
  <li >Brave</li>
  <li >Vivaldi</li>
  <li >Opera</li>
  <li >DuckDuckGo</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems so far that this webspace looks good using different browsers on
different hardware devices.</p>

<h3>Viewport</h3>
    
<p>When programming this page, it became necessary to deal with the so-called viewport.
Especially when sizes should be used in percent the real dimensions are of interest. I 
programmed in JavaScript quick an dirty a website, which analyses a website and prints
all the data which are available.</p>
    
<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è'"> 
  <li><a href="./html/viewport.html">Website Viewport</a></li>  
</ul>

<h2>How To Get In Touch With Me</h2>

<p>Best way to get in touch with me is using
<a href="https://discord.gg/T4NsWzrk">Discord</a>. 
Following the invitation link and visit me at Discord for communication with me and
get also more informations. On X as well as on Bluesky I am not answering or responding
anymore. Most of the enquiries there are fraud attempts or something similar.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>I found a funny usage of github.io homepages. GitHub user rbeesley adapted the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/edge/features/surf-game?msockid=2b0b2857ec9a64c91dab3">
Microsoft Edge game S.U.R.F</a>. to use is with every browsers and putted this game on
a github.io homepage.
