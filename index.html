<h1>Short Biography</h1>

<h2>Introductory Words</h2>

<p>This webspace is a simple introduction to who I am and what I do. In general I like photography 
and graphic design. I have just over 40 years of experience in both fields. Everything about images
and image manipulation is of interest for me. Currently I am also interested in Artificial Intelligence,
Generative Artificial Intelligence image generation, Crypto Coin and NFT technology.</p>  
    
<p>Over a decade I am no longer working on personal computers with the operating system Windows. At
that time when I used Windows I had in parallel to work on Unix as well as on Sinix and worked private
on Linux. I am now working for a long time exclusively under Linux, use only open source software and
do my own programming.</p> 
    
<p>In mathematics, physics as well as computer science and technology I am also interested. One topic I deal with at regular
intervals is the number Pi and how to calculate it. I am further on interested in theology, philosophy and history.</p>

<p>At the moment, GitHub in particular is a vendor's tray for me with various repositories on different topics. Through this website, I am trying
to bring some order to the things that are important to me and that might also be of interest to others.</p>
    
<h2>Corporate Identity</h2>
    
<p>Whenever you see my banner, my logo or my avatar, than the creator and owner should be me of the related web space. As my graphics are often 
stolen - they must be really good enough for some people - one needs to take a closer look to see if it is me or a dummy or fake site. This can
be easily checked by cross links, if my pseudonym or alias, my banner, my logo as well as my avatar is the same and so on.</p>

<h2>Information Technology Realted Online Activities</h2>    
    
<h3>Presence in Social Media Channels</h3>
    
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://x.com/zentrocdot">X</a> (formally Twitter) and recently also on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zentrocdot.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>. 
Both are the showroom for my activities in graphic design and programming. You can also find me on the communication platform <a href="https://discord.gg/T4NsWzrk">Discord</a>.
I have also a web presence at <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zentrocdot">Buymeacoffee</a>. The latter one is not maintained by me so often
these days.</p>

<h3>Presence on Developer Platforms</h3>
    
<p>I am active from time to time here at <a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot">GitHub</a>. And last but not least I am every now and
again at Launchpad and CPAN. Due to a lack of time, I am currently spending less time on <a href="https://launchpad.net/~zentrocdot"> Launchpad</a> 
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/ZTENRETEP">CPAN</a>. Unfortunately, I do not have the time I need for GitHub, Launchpad and CPAN.</p>

<p>The entry page for users and developers is on GitHub [2] and Launchpad [3] the same. For CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, the entry
site for users is [4] and for developers [5].</p>

<h3>Generative AI Related Comunity</h3>
    
<p>After some initial hesitation, I took a closer look at CIVITAI and am now very impressed with this platform. Accordingly one can find me
also now on <a href="https://civitai.com/user/zentrocdot">CIVITAI</a>. On CIVITA one can find Embeddings, Hypernetworks, LoRAs, DreamBooth models 
as well as merged base models of myself.</p>    
    
<h3>Presence on NFT Marketplaces</h3>
   
<p>As I wrote I am interested in the NFT technology. In this area I am active at three places. One can find me on
<a href="https://opensea.io/zentrocdot">Opensea</a>, 
<a href="https://rarible.com/zentrocdot">Rarible</a> and 
<a href="https://magiceden.io/u/zentrocdot?chains=%5B%22polygon%22%5D&wallets=%5B%220x8cBDE1015019f21bac2c68866A65f23eD2daC6A4%22%5D&activeTab=%22allItems%22">Magic Eden</a>. 
Most of the NFTs there are for personal use. Some are to give them away in good hands.

<h1>Programming Languages</h1>

<h2>Programming Languages I Am Familiar With</h2>

<p>Some of the programming languages I am familiar with are:</p>
  
<ul style="list-style-type: 'üîπ '">
    <li>Machine Language</li>
    <li>Assembler</li>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Basic</li>
    <li>Pascal/Turbo Pascal</li>
    <li>Fortran</li>
    <li>Batch</li>  
    <li>Visual Basic</li>
    <li>Shell/Bash</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Perl</li> 
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Markdown</li>  
    <li>HTML/XML</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>sed</li>
    <li>awk</li>  
    <li>bc</li>
    <li>roff</li>
    <li>Tex/LaTex</li>
    <li>Tcl/Tk</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list is certainly not complete. I always use the programming language that gets me to my goal the quickest. See also [2] for an
incredible long list of outdated and current programming languages. If necessary, I also learn a new programming language.</p>

<h2>Comments on the Mentioned Programming Languages</h2>    

<p>In computer programming, machine code is the computer code consisting of machine language instructions, which are used to control
and interact with the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. For conventional computers on binary base, machine code is the binary
representation of a computer program which can be read and interpreted by the computer respectively by the CPU. Such a program in machine
code consists of a sequence of machine instructions sometime interspersed with data. Machine code commands can be processed
directly by a CPU as mentioned. Each command is given in binary form with zeros and ones.</p>

<p>The machine code is by definition not natural for human beings. Here comes the assembler into play. An assembler works with the so-called
mnemonics which makes progamming on processor level easier and more natural for a human being. Commands are no longer given in a combination
of zeros and ones. Assembler uses e.g commands like shift arithmetic right (SAR) and shift logical right (SHR). The list of available assembler
commands varies from processor type to procesor type. One good example is a so-called RISC processor, whereas RISC is the abbreviation for 
Reduced Instruction Set Computer.<p>

<p>The next level on programming languages are C/C++ which are near to the assembler programming. Other programming languages e.g. are again
written in C/C++.</p>

<p>What Batch programming was under Windows, Shell/Bash programming is under Linux. At least they are comparable in terms of their approach,
before I am criticised for the above statement.</p>

<p>sed, awk as well as bc are commonly known as Bash commands. What most people do not realise or know is that sed, awk and bc are fully-fledged
programming languages.</p>

<p>My favourite programming languages are Bash, Python and Perl. First I take a look, if a problem can be solved using Bash, than I take a look,
if a ploblem can be solved using Python. Last but not least I am deciding if I have to use Perl or another Programming language.</p>

<h2>What is a Programming Language</h2>  

<p>The programming language itself is nothing else than semantic and syntactic rules and restrictions. To bring them to live one needs a interpreter or 
compiler or maybe a mixture from both.</p>

<h2>What is an Interpreter and What is a Compiler</h2>

<p>While running a script or programme the interpreter is interpreting the code and reads the code line by line. A Compiler creates binary code while compiling 
from the source code. The result is an executable programme.</p>

<h1>Photography and Grafic Design</h1>

<p>Linux is a good platform when it comes to tools for photography and graphic design. Linux has one weakness compared to Windows. 
Printed Good print quality is easier to realise with Windows if the appropriate drivers are available.</p>   

<p>Subsequently listed Tools are in use by me:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: 'üî© '">
    <li>RawTherapee</li>
    <li>Gimp</li>
    <li>G'MIC</li>
    <li>Inkscape</li>
    <li>ImageMagick</li>
</ul>

<p>RawTherapee is a programme aimed at photographers. Gimp is a good image editing programme. G'MIC is among other things a plugin for Gimp.
Inkscape is a good vector graphics programme. Last but not least ImageMagick is a command line tool for image manipulation of all kinds.</p>  

<p>As I learned Stable Diffusion can be used for much more than simple AI image generation. With Stable Diffusion images can be easily upscaled.
A magic eraser functionality can be realised by Stable Diffusion too.</p>     

<h1>Generative Artificial Image Generation</h1>

<p>The possibilities of the Generative Artificial Image Generation are an interesting extension if you work with photos and graphics.</p> 

<h1>Stable Diffusion Model Development</h1>

<p>Following types of models I am developing so far:</p>   
 
<ul style="list-style-type: '‚úèÔ∏è '">
    <li>Embeddings / Textual Inversions</li>
    <li>Hypernetworks</li>
    <li>LoRA models</li>
    <li>DreamBooth models</li>
    <li>Base models</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment my focus lies on Embeddings, Hypernetworks and LoRAs.</p>    

<h1>Programming Extensions for the Web UI AUTOMATIC1111</h1> 

<p>I have always lacked options for working more effectively in AI image generation. Since AUTOMATIC1111 offers the
option of integrating self-programmed Extensions in the web UI, I familiarised myself with the programming of these
Extensions.</p>

<p>The Extensions I have developed so far can be found here:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è '"> 
  <li><a href="./html/extensions.html">Extensions for the AUTOMATIC1111 web UI </a></li>  
</ul>

<p>The corresponding website is updated according to the development status of the individual Extensions. Each
Extension has more or less good documentation to date.</p>
 
<h1>NFT Technology</h1>
    
<h2>Thoughts about NFT Technology</h2>  

<p>Today, NFT marketplaces are far more than just platforms on which NFTs can be traded. If you utilise the possibilities correctly,
these marketplaces are galleries for your own ideas and images.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that the common NFT marketplaces make it easy to mint NFTs. It is much more complicated to set
up a working environment that allows to mint NFTs. In my case, this is not an option for now as it is too time consuming.</p>

<p>It looks to me as if NFTs are still only seen as an object for speculation. I do not think this does the technology justice. With
NFTs, you can have your own pictures with you anytime and anywhere. Access is easy via smartphone, tablet or personal computer to each
time and at each location.</p>    

<h2>Favourite NFT image Collections</h2>  

<p>Art should be shown. In order to realise this for myself personally, I have been creating NFTs for a long time. That way I can carry the pictures
around in my wallet.</p>

</ul>

<h1>Self Programmed Applications</h1>

<h2>Hard- and Software Programming</h2>

<p>I programmed some high sophisticated application which I can not present in detail.</p>
    
<p>A long time ago, in the 80s, I programmed a self-designed and self-manufactured fully automatic calf feeding system
in Turbo Pascal. The hardware and software was intended to show that it was possible to do this with an x68 personal
computer Computer for calf health to that time.</p> 

<p>I have programmed video surveillance monitors in Python. These allow you to take a look at one or more specific
cameras when needed while video surveillance with motion detection was running in the background. This way I was able
to help catch some bad girls and boys.</p>    
    
<h2>Wireless Access Point Scanner</h2>

<p>Since 2017, I have been using my own wireless access point scanner without making any necessary changes. The tool 
is simple and easy to use. Programmed is the tool using Bash.</p>    

<p>Installation can be done by using a PPA applying following steps:</p>    
    
<pre>
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zentrocdot/wapscan-cli
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install wapscan
</pre>  
    
<p>Informations and resources can be found here:</p> 

<ul style="list-style-type: '‚û°Ô∏è '">    
    <li><a href=" https://github.com/zentrocdot/wapscan_sd">https://github.com/zentrocdot/wapscan_sd</a></li>
</ul>

<p>wapscan is a tool for the terminal window. The tool can used with more than one wlan interfaces. It is as simple as possible. The goal is simply to show the
wireless access point in the surounding with some impportant informations about them.<p>

<p>When I have more time I have to take alook at the tool and have to check if an update or upgrade is necessary.<p>

<h1>Circle Constant Pi and Tau</h1>
    
<h2>Archimedes and Pi</h2>

<p>I am particularly proud of the fact that I was able to work through Archimedes' foundations for calculating the circle number Pi in the form of SageMath notebooks,
which can be found here on GitHub. Archimedes' approach is based on ratios of quantities and it is complicated to translate these ratios of quantities into mathematical
equations. One particular problem is that he used different approaches for the inscribed circle and the circumscribed circle.<p>

<p>My resources can be found here:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: 'üìö '">
   <li><a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot/archimedes">https://github.com/zentrocdot/archimedes</a></li>
</ul>    

<p>When it comes to the calculation of Pi in connection with Archimedes, incorrect statements are usually made. At the time of Archimedes, 
techniques relating to algebra and geometry that are used today to derive his calculation rule were not yet known. These modern approaches 
are nothing more than a correct interpretation of his approaches, nothing more and nothing less. The prove of the statement is given with 
a look in Archimedes' Circuli Dimensio and his 3 propositions.</p>

<p>This project has stalled because I don't have enough time.</p>

<h2>Calculation of the Circle Constant Pi</h2>

<p>As far as the basis for calculating the circle number Pi is concerned, I went back a long way into the past and conducted
an intensive search for sources. This revealed interesting aspects and approaches, some of which are reproduced incorrectly or
distorted in today's literature. For example, I also found calculation approaches dating back round about 100 years that were
already known in the Middle Ages. Next to the geometric analysis I wrot a bunch of programmes in Python and Perl to this topic.</p>

<p>This project has also stalled because I don't have enough time.</p>

<h1>Further Interesting Resources</h1>

<p>I am working with the mathematical tool SageMath. To make a straight forward installation for me easier I wrote a installation guide.</p>

<p>To have the newest version of LibreOffice I figured out how to compile and install it from source with language support and everything else
what is neede to have a state of the art system.</p>

<h1>About This Website</h1>

<p>This website was created by me in the familiar old-fashioned form. I wrote the website with
the help of a text editor. Sometimes I use HTML editors to test certain things. As a rule, however,
I am always much quicker at programming by hand than when I use other tools. Since this site does
not claim to be a professional site, this is sufficient for me and for the presentation of information.
Since I like the story of Jekyll and Hyde, I will try programming based on Jekyll when I have a lot
of idle time.</p>

<h1>How To Get In Touch With Me</h1>

<p>Best way to get in touch with me is using <a href="https://discord.gg/T4NsWzrk">Discord</a>. 
Following the invitation link and visit me at Discord for communication with me and get also
more informations. On X as well as on Bluesky I am not answering or responding anymore. Most of
the enquiries there are fraud attempts or something similar.</p>
