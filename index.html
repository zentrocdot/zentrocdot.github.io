<h2>Short Biography</h2>  
<p align=justify> 
This webspace is a simple introduction to who I am and what I do. I like photography and graphics. I have just over 40 years of experience
in both fields. I am also interested in Artificial Intelligence, Generative Artificial Intelligence image generation, Crypto Coin and NFT
technology. I work exclusively under Linux, use only open source software and do my own programming. In mathematics, physics
and computer technology I am also interested. I am further on interested in theology, philosophy and history.
</p>
<h2>Social Media</h2>   
<p align=justify>You can find me on Twitter and on Bluesky. I also have a web presence at Buymeacoffee. 
You can also find me on Discord. I am active at GitHub. And last but not least I am at Launchpad and CPAN. I am in the process
of reorganizing the social media and programming accounts.
</p>
<h2>NFT Marketplaces</h2>
<p align=justify>One can find me on OpenSea, Rarible and Magic Eden.</p>
<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

Some of the programming languages I am familiar with:
  
<ul>
  <li>Machine Language</li>
  <li>Assembler</li>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>Basic</li>
  <li>Pascal/Turbo Pascal</li>
  <li>Fortran</li>  
  <li>Bash</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Perl</li> 
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Markdown</li>  
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>sed</li>
  <li>awk</li>  
  <li>bc</li>
  <li>roff</li>
  <li>Tex/LaTex</li>
  <li>Tcl/Tk</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The above list is certainly not complete. I always use the programming language that leads me to my goal the fastest.
    If necessary, I also learn a new programming language..</p>
    
<p align="justify">There are some comments necessary to the former list of programming languages. Machine language commands can be processed
directly by a processor. Every command is given in binary form using 0 and 1. This is per definition not natural to human beings. Here comes 
the assembler into play. An assembler works with the so-called mnemonics which makes progamming on processor level easier for a human being.
Commands are no longer given in a combination of 0 and 1. Assembler uses e.g commands like shift arithmetic right (SAR) and shift logical right
(SHR). The next level on programming languages are C/C++ which are near to the assembler programming. Other programming languages e.g. are again
written in C/C++. Here we have to talk about interpreter and compiler. The programming language itself is nothing else than semantic and syntactic
rules and restrictions. To bring them to live one needs a interpreter or compiler.</p>
