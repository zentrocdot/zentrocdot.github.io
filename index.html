<h1>Short Biography</h1>

<h2>Introductory Words</h2>

<p>This webspace is a simple introduction to who I am and what I do. In general I like photography and graphic design. I have just over 40 years of experience in both fields. 
Everything about images and image manipulation is of interest for me. Currently I am also interested in Artificial Intelligence, Generative Artificial Intelligence image generation,
Crypto Coin and NFT technology.<p> 
    
<p>Over a decade I am no longer working on personal computers with the operating system Windows. At that time when I used Windows I had in paralell to work on Unix as well as on Sinix
and worked private on Linux. I am now working for a long time exclusively under Linux, use only open source software and do my own programming.<p> 
    
In mathematics, physics as well as computer science and technology I am also interested. One topic I deal with at regular
intervals is the number Pi and how to calculate it. I am further on interested in theology, philosophy and history.<p>

<p>At the moment, Github in particular is a vendor's tray for me with various repositories on different topics. Through this website, I'm trying to bring some order to the things that 
are important to me and that might also be of interest to others.<p>
    
<h2>Corporate Identity</h2>
    
<p>Whenever you see my banner, my logo or my avatar, than the creator and owner should be me of the related web space. As my graphics are often stolen - they must be good enough for
some people - one needs to take a closer look to see if it is me or a dummy or fake site. This can be easily checked by cross links, if my avatar is the same and so on.</p>
    
<h2>Social Media Presence</h2>
    
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://x.com/zentrocdot">X (formally Twitter)</a> and recently also on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zentrocdot.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>.
I have also a web presence at <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zentrocdot">Buymeacoffee</a>. The latter one is not maintained by me so often these days. You can also find me
on <a href="https://discord.gg/T4NsWzrk">Discord</a>. I am active from time to time here at <a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot">GitHub</a>. And last but not least I am at
Launchpad and CPAN.</p>
    
<p>After some initial hesitation, I took a closer look at CIVITAI and am now very impressed with this platform. Accordingly one can find me now on
<a href="https://civitai.com/user/zentrocdot">CIVITAI</a>.</p>    

<p>Currently I am in the process of reorganizing the social media and programming accounts.</p>
    
<h2>Activities on NFT Marketplaces</h2>
    
<p>As I wrote I am interested in the NFT technology. In this area I am active at three places. One can find me on <a href="https://opensea.io/zentrocdot">Opensea</a>, 
<a href="https://rarible.com/zentrocdot">Rarible</a> and <a href="https://magiceden.io/u/zentrocdot?chains=%5B%22polygon%22%5D&wallets=%5B%220x8cBDE1015019f21bac2c68866A65f23eD2daC6A4%22%5D&activeTab=%22allItems%22">Magic Eden</a>.      
   
<h1>Programming Languages</h1>

<h2>Programming Languages I Know</h2>

<p>Some of the programming languages I am familiar with:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Machine Language</li>
  <li>Assembler</li>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>Basic</li>
  <li>Pascal/Turbo Pascal</li>
  <li>Fortran</li>
  <li>Batch</li>  
  <li>Visual Basic</li>
  <li>Shell/Bash</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Perl</li> 
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Markdown</li>  
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>sed</li>
  <li>awk</li>  
  <li>bc</li>
  <li>roff</li>
  <li>Tex/LaTex</li>
  <li>Tcl/Tk</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list is certainly not complete. I always use the programming language that gets me to my goal the quickest. If necessary,
I also learn a new programming language.</p>

<h2>Comments on the Programming Languages</h2>    

<p>In computer programming, machine code is the computer code consisting of machine language instructions, which are used to control
and interact with the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. For conventional computers on binary base, machine code is the binary
representation of a computer program which can be read and interpreted by the computer respectively by the CPU. Such a program in machine
code consists of a sequence of machine instructions sometime interspersed with data. Machine code commands can be processed
directly by a CPU as mentioned. Each command is given in binary form with zeros and ones.</p>

<p>The machine code is by definition not natural for human beings. Here comes the assembler into play. An assembler works with the so-called
mnemonics which makes progamming on processor level easier and more natural for a human being. Commands are no longer given in a combination of zeros
and ones. Assembler uses e.g commands like shift arithmetic right (SAR) and shift logical right (SHR). The list of available assembler commands varies
from processor type to procesor type. One good example is a so-called RISC processor, whereas RISC is the abbreviation for Reduced Instruction Set Computer.<p>

<p>The next level on programming languages are C/C++ which are near to the assembler programming. Other programming languages e.g. are again
written in C/C++.</p>

<h2>What is a Programming Language</h2>  

<p>The programming language itself is nothing else than semantic and syntactic rules and restrictions. To bring them to live one needs a interpreter or 
compiler or maybe a mixture from both.</p>

<h2>What is an Interpreter and What is a Compiler</h2>

<p>While running a script or programme the interpreter is interpreting the code and reads the code line by line. A Compiler creates binary code while compiling 
from the source code. The result is an executable programme.</p>

<h1>NFT Technology</h1>
    
<h2>Thoughts about NFT Technology</h2>  

<p>It looks to me as if NFTs are still only seen as an object of speculation. I don't think this does the technology justice. With NFTs, you can have your own pictures with 
you anytime and anywhere. Access is easy via smartphone, tablet or personal computer to each time and at each location.</p>    

<h2>Favourite NFT image Collections</h2>  

<p>Art should be shown. In order to realise this for myself personally, I have been creating NFTs for a long time. That way I can carry the pictures around in my wallet.</p>

<h1>Extensions for the web UI AUTOMATIC1111</h1> 

<p>After reaching my limits in terms of AI image generation, I started to build my own models in form of Embeddings, Hypernetworks and LORAs. In the process, I realised that I was
missing extensions to be able to work better. 
So I learnt how to programme these extensions.</p>

<h1>Further interesting Resources</h1>

<p>I am working with the mathematical tool SageMath. To make a straight forward installation for me easier I wrote a installation guide.</p>

<ul>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/zentrocdot/SageMath">https://github.com/zentrocdot/SageMath</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To have the newest version of LibreOffice I figured out how to compile and install it from source with language support and everything else
what is neede to have a state of the art system.</p>

<h1>WapScan PPA</h1>

<p>Since 2017, I have been using my own wireless access point scanner without making any necessary changes. The tool is simple and easy to use. Programmed is the tool using Bash.</p>    

<p>Installation can be done by using a PPA applying following steps:</p>    
    
<pre>
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zentrocdot/wapscan-cli
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install wapscan
</pre>  
    
<p>Informations and resources can be found here:</p> 
  
<li><a href=" https://github.com/zentrocdot/wapscan_sd">https://github.com/zentrocdot/wapscan_sd</a></li>

<p>wapscan is a tool for the terminal window. The tool can used with more than one wlan interfaces. It is as simple as possible. The goal is simply to show the
wireless access point in the surounding with some impportant informations about them.<p>

<p>When I have more time I have to take alook at the tool and have to check if an update or upgrade is necessary.<p>
